# SpectrumPeakProcessingSystem
The system is a comprehensive system which can collect and analyze the spectrum peak. First of all, the system uses thread pool technology to create a user-readable hardware timing control module. The user can flexibly edit the timing events of spectrum acquisition according to their own needs, and realize the orderly intelligent control of relay, motor, led, fan, PT100 temperature sensor, thermocouple temperature sensor, pressure sensor, flow sensor, flame detector and other hardware To complete the collection of spectrogram. At the same time, the system has a perfect self-test program and basic hardware access management functions, which can ensure the normal operation of the hardware in the ideal state. Secondly, the system has the characteristics of multi-channel flexible expansion and independent operation, which can meet the actual needs of various scenarios. Finally, the system has perfect data saving and playback functions, and provides basic report printing function.
